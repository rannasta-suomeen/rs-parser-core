# rs-parser-core

As the number for various parsers for rannasta-suomeen.fi keeps on increasing, the core code for handling insertion and type-safety of drinks shpuld be kept in one place

This is the place, and *yes, `products` are referred as `drinks` here due to legacy reasons* *(this shit was first written couple years ago, when rannasta-suomeen was just a better product viewer for Superalko)*

## Usage
* See `src/index.ts` for documentation
* Use like any GitHub hosted npm package
* Don't even dare to open issues or mention tests, it's legacy, it's 277 lines of TypeScript, and the parsers are constantly broken anyways

*in all seriousness though, feel free to write an issue for it to be completely ignored by lazy devs. We have better shit to do with both the app and the frontend*
